# Area-Exploration-Simulator
CPE 400 Semester Project 
This project simulates a set of 'drones' exploring a region. 
The program will start with a blank region, and when prompted, a set of drones will move around the map creating a line of sight around them.
The goal is to simulate a effecient exploration of a certain sized region with a set of n drones that can move x units before needing to recharge.
Additionally, a bitmap is created as the region to explore, using a modified simplex noise algorithm to generate a realistic looking space.
